// D-20-style multitrack step sequencer engine, ported from the D-110 emulator's
// D110SequencerEngine 2026-09-09 (see ~/src/D110/d110-vst-emulator, docs/sequencer.md) -
// deliberately firmware-agnostic by design in the source project already: it knows about MIDI
// channels, beats and sample counts, not firmware RAM, which is exactly what made lifting it
// here a mechanical rename rather than a rewrite. The owning VirtualJVProcessor supplies which
// live MIDI channel each track maps to (see setChannelSource) - here, each track IS one of the
// 8 JV-880 Performance Parts (7 melodic + Rhythm), and the channel comes from that Part's own
// configured receive channel.
//
// Time base: a "beat" is always a quarter note, matching standard MIDI file semantics
// (tempo in BPM = quarter notes per minute) - this is what lets tracks round-trip
// through juce::MidiFile without any unit conversion beyond ticks-per-quarter-note.
// The time signature only affects bar-length/metronome-grid math, not the beat unit
// events are stored in.
