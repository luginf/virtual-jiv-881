// D-20-style alternate view of the sequencer: a small text LCD plus 9 hardware-style
// buttons (STOP/PLAY/REC, 4 arrows, ENTER, EXIT) instead of JivSequencerPanel's mouse-
// driven grid of controls. Same host contract, same footprint, fully interchangeable
// with JivSequencerPanel - whichever one the owning editor makes visible is a matter of
// JivSequencerHost's own getSequencerRetroMode() flag, not something this class knows or
// cares about itself. Every action here calls the exact same JivSequencerEngine/
// JivSequencerHost methods JivSequencerPanel's mouse controls already do - see
// JivSequencerPanel.cpp for the call sites this mirrors.
//
// Navigation model: a stack of Screens (EXIT pops, a List/Form item's own onEnter/
// onConfirm pushes). HOME is a List Screen like any other (built once by
// buildHomeMenu(), held in homeScreen) - top() returns it whenever the stack is empty,
// so it's never pushed/popped itself, just permanently at the bottom. List/Form/Confirm/
// NameEdit are the only 4 screen kinds - every menu is data (a Screen built by one of the
// buildXyz() methods below), not a bespoke class, so adding a new menu item never needs a
// new paint/input code path. A List row can optionally add a horizontal quick-bar
// (ListItem::quickActions, LEFT/RIGHT-cycled/ENTER-fired) or a live scrub
// (ListItem::onAdjust, LEFT/RIGHT drives it directly) - see ListItem's own comment - used
// by HOME's TRACK/SONG/TRANSPORT/BAR rows to reach fast actions without a submenu hop.
//
// Callback convention, load-bearing for stack safety: a List item's onEnter may freely
// push/pop the navigation stack (that's how menus nest). A Form/Confirm screen's
// onConfirm must NEVER touch the navigation stack itself - only engine()/processor state
// - because the dispatcher (pressEnter) always pops the form/confirm screen itself right
// after calling onConfirm, and holds no reference across that call, but onConfirm mutating
// the stack underneath it would still leave the model inconsistent.

	//    several fast actions (REC/PLAY/MUTE/...) without a submenu hop.
	//  - onAdjust: LEFT/RIGHT calls onAdjust(+-1) directly against live engine state, no
	//    dialled index involved - lets a row that opens a submenu still be scrubbed in place
	//    without opening it. Used by HOME's BAR row (mirroring what HomeField::bar used to do
	//    before HOME became a plain list) and, by the same logic, TEMPO/PRECOUNT/LOOP on their
	//    own submenus (Alan's request, 2026-08-23) - ENTER still opens the full submenu in all

	// 2026-08-23 - moving a cursor among one field was always a no-op, so this just gives
	// LEFT/RIGHT something to do); on a multi-field form it instead moves the cursor to the
	// next/previous field, same as always, since something still has to reach the other
