    PanelSkin.h

    Photo-based JV-880 front panel control, shared by two different places (Alan's request,
    2026-09-08 - "fais pareil que pour le D110"): the top-of-window display (Settings tab lets
    Alan pick "Panel Compact" or "Panel Full" instead of the plain LCD-only strip, replacing
    LCDisplay there and embedding that same live LCD render into the photo, like D110Panel does)
    and the Interface tab (an ultra-compact buttons-only crop, for anyone who keeps "LCD only" up
    top and still wants clickable panel buttons somewhere).

    All three photos this class can be pointed at - jiv881.png (full, 3280x304), jiv881_panel_
    compact.png (2012x304) and jiv881_commands.png (buttons/dial only, no LCD/Volume, 948x304) -
    turned out to be EXACT pixel crops of the same underlying artwork (confirmed by a direct
    numpy diff, not assumed): jiv881_panel_compact.png == jiv881.png's columns [382, 2394), and
    jiv881_commands.png == jiv881.png's columns [1435, 2383). So there is exactly ONE measured
    coordinate table (kButtons, the dial/volume circle centres, the LCD glass rect - all below, in
    "full" reference space, kMasterRefW x kMasterRefH = 3280x304, found by the same connected-
    component analysis used for the original compact-only skin, not eyeballed) and each Variant
    below is just that table windowed by an x-offset and a width - see Variant::kFull/kCompact/
    kCommands.
